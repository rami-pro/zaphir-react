# ZAPHIR react

**zaphir-react** is the frontend part of my side project, wich is a web site where people share their favorite places and memories with other people.

this project was built mainly with **React** and the technologies and patterns that come with it (**context**, **custom hooks**, **portals**,**react-router** ...etc)
